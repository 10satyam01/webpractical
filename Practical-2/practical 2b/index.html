                    When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had be en a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend 
                    for a noncaffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of  fizzy water and                     
                    artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored                     
                    carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask;I                     
                    haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternat ive for the times when you're                    
                     feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or m ilk.

                    The inner seating area is shady and gives a classic tone t o the restaurant where as the outdoor seating is comparatively more modern wit h Graffiti's and funky wall frames. <br>

                    I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing V anilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only place I've ever ordered a Van illa Bean Latte from.  
                    I'm not even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte  is supposed to taste like.  
                    What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a wh im from CoHo was delicious.
